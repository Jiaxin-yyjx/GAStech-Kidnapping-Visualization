# Final_Project: GAStech Kidnapping

## Introduction
This project is the Mini-challenge 1 in 2021 in IEEE visual analytics benchmarks repository. http://visualdata.wustl.edu/varepository/VAST%20Challenge%202021/challenges/MC1/ 

GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in Kronos for about twenty years. The company has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in local environmental protection and management. Once several employees of GAStech go missing, an organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearances due to the previous conflict. The overall question of our team is to look at the relationships and conditions that led to the kidnapping during GAStechâ€™s celebration activity in 2014.
